# ðŸ¦… Soar: A CLI Helper for the Johns Hopkins University Crunchr Platform

This package is a CLI helper for the Johns Hopkins University Crunchr platform. It is designed to automate tasks that would otherwise be tedious, such as:

* Mounting network volumes.
* Preparing containers with the necessary software and dependencies, such as Java runtimes, database drivers, and R/Python packages.
* Managing credentials in a secure vault that can be easily accessed from R/Python.
* Storing known-working database drivers and other dependencies.
* Generating config files for analysis notebooks, including database connection strings.
* Enhancing the shell environment to be more productive.
* Configuring RStudio settings on new container instances.

This package is currently under development.

Soar is written in Python.
